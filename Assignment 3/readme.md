# Assignment 3: Testing & Model Serving

## Introduction
The assignment consists of two main tasks: 
- Unit Testing
- Flask Serving
  
The goal is to ensure that the scoring function for a trained model works correctly and to create a Flask endpoint for serving model predictions.

## Task Overview
1. **Unit Testing (score.py and test.py):**
   - Implement a scoring function in `score.py` that takes a text, a trained model, and a threshold as input and returns the prediction and propensity.
   - Write unit tests in `test.py` to validate the scoring function. Test cases should cover various scenarios, including input/output formats, prediction values, propensity scores, and threshold effects.

2. **Flask Serving (app.py and test.py):**
   - Create a Flask endpoint `/score` in `app.py` that receives a text as a POST request and returns the prediction and propensity in JSON format.
   - Write an integration test in `test.py` to ensure that the Flask app behaves as expected. The test should launch the Flask app, send a request to the endpoint, and verify the response.

## Directory Structure
- `score.py`: Contains the scoring function implementation.
- `test.py`: Contains unit and integration tests for the scoring function and Flask endpoint.
- `app.py`: Contains the Flask application code.
- `coverage.txt`: Output file containing the coverage report generated by pytest.
