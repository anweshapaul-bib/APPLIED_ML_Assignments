# Assignment 5

The assignment covers two main topics:

1. Transfer Learning for Image Data using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):
   - Downloaded 100 images of ducks and 100 images of chickens from the internet
   - Fine-tuned a pre-trained CNN model to classify duck vs. chicken images

2. Transfer Learning for Text Data using Transformers:
   - Downloaded the sentiment analysis dataset from Kaggle
   - Built a sentiment analysis classifier (positive, neutral, negative)
   - Fine-tuned a pre-trained transformer model (BERT)
