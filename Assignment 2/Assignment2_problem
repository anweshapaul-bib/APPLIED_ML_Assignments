Assignment 2: 
Experiment Tracking 

1. Data version control
  In prepare.ipynb track the versions of data using dvc
    - load the raw data into raw_data.csv and save the split data into
    train.csv/validation.csv/test.csv
    - update train/validation/test split by choosing different random seed
    - checkout the first version (before update) using dvc and print the distribution
    of target variable (number of 0s and number of 1s) in train.csv, validation.csv,
    and test.csv
    - checkout the updated version using dvc and print the distribution of target
    variable in train.csv, validation.csv, test.csv
    - bonus: (decouple compute and storage) track the data versions using google
    drive as storage

2. Model version control and experiment tracking
  In train.ipynb track the experiments and model versions using mlflow
    - build, track, and register 3 benchmark models using MLflow
    - checkout and print AUCPR for each of the three benchmark models
