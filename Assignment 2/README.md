# DVC: Data Version Control

## Overview:
This project involves model training and experiment tracking using MLflow. It includes building, tracking, and registering benchmark models such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, Random Forest, and an ensemble model (Stacking Classifier). Additionally, it checks out and prints AUCPR for each of the benchmark models.
