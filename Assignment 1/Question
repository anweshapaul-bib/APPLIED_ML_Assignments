Assignment 1:
Build a prototype for email spam classification.

1. in prepare.ipynb write the functions to:
  ○ load the data from a given file path
  ○ preprocess the data (if needed)
  ○ split the data into train/validation/test
  ○ store the splits at train.csv/validation.csv/test.csv

2. in train.ipynb write the functions to:
  ○ fit a model on train data
  ○ score a model on given data
  ○ evaluate the model predictions
  ○ validate the model
    i. fit on train
    ii. score on train and validation
    iii. evaluate on train and validation
    iv. fine-tune using train and validation (if necessary)
  ○ score 3 benchmark models on test data and select the best one

Notes:
  - You may download the email spam data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackksoncsie/spam-email-dataset
  - You may refer to https://radimrehurek.com/data_science_python/ for building a prototype.
  - You may refer to first 3 chapters of https://www.statlearning.com/ for basic ML concepts.
  - You may refer to the Solution Design example covered in the class as a guideline for the experiment
  design.
